Flip It! â€“ A Card Flip Memory Game 

I built a memory card flip game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game challenges users to match all card pairs with as few moves as possible.

Features:
â€¢ Smooth flip animations
â€¢ Fully responsive design
â€¢ Light/Dark Mode toggle
â€¢ Win celebration: a fun celebration effect triggers when the game is complete
