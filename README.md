Flip It! – A Card Flip Memory Game 

I built a memory card flip game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game challenges users to match all card pairs with as few moves as possible.

Features:

• Smooth flip animations

• Fully responsive design

• Light/Dark Mode toggle

• Win celebration: a fun celebration effect triggers when the game is complete
